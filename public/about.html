<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I've recently graduated from UC Davis with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. I am interested in a career in 
  software engineering and development. During college, I was involved in both a smart IoT coffee machine and a web fitness 
  tracker project where I developed skills in iOS development, C, C++, Python, Arduino, AWS, full-stack web development, 
  and problem-solving. I've also developed soft skills like effective communication, particularly in communicating technical 
  ideas to technical and non-technical people by conducting presentations, live demos, and videos to the UC Davis engineering 
  professors and UC Davis general student body. In addition, I have developed soft skills in customer service, 
  teamwork, team building, and leadership as a Resident Advisor during my college years. I'd love to learn more about 
  opportunities in software engineering and development. Please feel free to reach out to me about any entry-level software 
  engineering positions you have.
