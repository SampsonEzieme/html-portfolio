<h1>The Best Movies According To Sampson</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>One of the first movies I remember watching. The music alone puts it at number 1, but this film literally has everything in it. Also the new version has Beyonc√© in it.</p>

<h3>Frozen 2</h3>
<p>The music was so good. The story, the action, the inspiration. The breaking point the redemption. Olaf was so funny. Show yourself.</p>

<h3>Sing</h3>
<p>Tori Kelly is in it. That's it. Jk it's really inspirational.</p>
